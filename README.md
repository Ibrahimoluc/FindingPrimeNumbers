# FindingPrimeNumbers
FindingPrimeNumbers 3 digit and starting with 5

I think the questions asks prime numbers from 500 to 599.
My strategy is so:
1- Find the prime numbers sqrt(599).
  - For finding them I will create a list. Initially it has one member '2'.
  - Then I will iterate from 3 to integer<sqrt(599) by 2. I mean 3,5,7,9... . Because prime numbers except 2 are odd numbers.
  - In every step I will check the number by dividing all numbers in list. If it is not divided by all the numbers in list, then I will add it in the list.
